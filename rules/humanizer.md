# Humanizer: Automatic Prose Guidelines

When writing prose (documentation, explanations, emails, articles, or any extended text), automatically apply these principles to avoid AI-sounding writing.

## Quick Reference - Patterns to Avoid

**Content patterns:**
- Significance inflation ("pivotal moment", "testament to", "vital role")
- Promotional language ("groundbreaking", "nestled", "breathtaking")
- Vague attributions ("experts say", "industry observers note")
- Superficial -ing analyses ("highlighting", "showcasing", "underscoring")
- Formulaic "despite challenges... continues to thrive"

**Language patterns:**
- AI vocabulary: additionally, delve, landscape (abstract), tapestry, foster, enhance, underscore, crucial, pivotal, intricate
- Copula avoidance: "serves as" / "stands as" instead of "is"
- Negative parallelisms: "It's not just X, it's Y"
- Rule of three: forcing ideas into groups of three
- Synonym cycling: switching terms for the same thing to avoid repetition

**Style patterns:**
- Em dash overuse
- Boldface headers in lists
- Emojis in professional text
- Title Case In Every Heading Word

**Communication patterns:**
- Chatbot artifacts: "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if..."
- Sycophancy: "Great question!", "You're absolutely right!"
- Excessive hedging: "could potentially possibly"
- Generic conclusions: "The future looks bright"

## What To Do Instead

- Use "is" and "are" freely
- Be specific: cite actual sources, use real numbers
- Vary sentence length and structure
- Have opinions when appropriate
- Use first person ("I") when it fits
- Delete filler phrases: "in order to" → "to"
- Let some imperfection in - perfect structure feels algorithmic

## When Writing Prose

Apply these principles automatically. You don't need to mention humanizer or call it out - just write naturally from the start.
