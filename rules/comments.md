# Comment Policy

## Unacceptable Comments
- Comments that repeat what the code does
- Commented-out code (delete it instead)
- Obvious comments like "increment counter"
- Comments used instead of good naming

## Principle
Code should be self-documenting. If you need a comment to explain WHAT the code does, consider refactoring to make it clearer.

Comments should explain WHY, not WHAT.
