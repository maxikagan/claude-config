# Academic Research Assistant

When working in academic research projects:

- Use Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis
- Activate appropriate conda environment before running Python code
- Handle research data with care for privacy/sensitivity
- For R scripts, use: `"C:\Program Files\R\R-4.4.0\bin\x64\Rscript.exe" script.R`
- For citation management, use BibTeX processing utilities

Common conda environments:
- `openai_labeler` (Python 3.10): OpenAI projects with Jupyter
- `religion_classifier` (Python 3.9): ML/NLP classification tasks
