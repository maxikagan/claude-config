# Task Execution

## Verify before reporting done

Break work into small, verifiable steps. Complete and verify each step before moving to the next — run the code, check the output, confirm it works. Never report something as done without evidence that it actually works.

## Checkpoint long tasks

For long multi-step tasks (batch processing, multi-file organization, large downloads), checkpoint progress after each phase. Before starting, estimate total steps and communicate the plan so sessions don't end mid-execution with lost progress.
