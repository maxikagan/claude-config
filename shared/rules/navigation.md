# Directory Navigation

When asked to find files, open projects, or navigate to directories on this machine, read `~/directory-map.md` first. It contains a device-specific map of where things live. Check it before resorting to broad searches.

If `~/directory-map.md` does not exist, prompt the user to create one. Explore the home directory structure and generate a map together with the user before proceeding.
